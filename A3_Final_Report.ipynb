        "Marketers and advertising companies, therefore, are interested in being able to predict whether a Twitter message will spread. One interesting emergent behaviour on Twitter is the practice of retweeting, which is the relaying of a tweet that has been written by another Twitter user. When a user finds an interesting tweet written by another user and wants to share it with her followers, she can retweet the tweet by copying the message (Suh et al. 2010). Moreover, marketing professionals have also embraced internet memes as a form of viral marketing to increase brand awareness and trendiness. It is easy to share internet memes in the form of Graphics Interchange Format (GIFs) and image macros to a large audience on Twitter and is cost-effective.\n",

        "# **CHALLENGES IN PREDICTING IF TWITTER MESSAGE WILL SPREAD**\n",
        "Predicting whether a Twitter message will spread is not straight-forward. Generally, there are challenges in social media data analytics, as discussed below:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Social media data are generated in vast quantities. They are highly dynamic and complex,\n",
        "exhibiting structured and unstructured characteristics. Structured data constitutes the user\n",
        "profile characteristics, thematic data and attention-related data such as the number of likes,\n",
        "retweets, mentions etc. while unstructured data include user-generated textual\n",
        "content(Steiglitz et al. 2014). This information overload cannot be processed easily using\n",
        "traditional data processing applications or database management but requires large\n",
        "computing capacities and sophisticated data sampling and extraction, which possesses\n",
        "potential issues in data mining.\n",
        " \n",
        "2. Another significant issue is the accuracy and objectivity of social media data. Social media\n",
        "platforms are infiltrated with duplicate and fake accounts affecting data relevance and\n",
        "quality. “As Boyd and Crawford(2012) point out large datasets from Internet sources are\n",
        "often unreliable because of their potential incompleteness and inconsistency and are\n",
        "always subject to limitations and biases, which can lead to misinterpretation” (Steiglitz et al.\n",
        "2014).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Many social media platforms do not provide easy methods of access to data. Even when\n",
        "Application Programming Interface (APIs) are provided, they are often subject to vague and\n",
        "ambiguous restrictions of data access and evolving business models of the platforms\n",
        "change. Furthermore, data formats need to be pre-processed to be used for further study\n",
        "and analysis, which incur additional costs.\n",
        " \n",
        "4. In addition, the fast-changing nature of the designs and concepts of social media platform\n",
        "analysis and unanticipated usage conventions by users pose another challenge. Some\n",
        "features that can possibly affect Retweet frequency are:\n",
        "\n",
        ">- Number of Followers: The more followers a user has, there is more visibility of his tweets.\n",
        "- Tweet Length: The more information a tweet contains, then the message can be more\n",
        "enjoyable and interesting.\n",
        "- The number of hashtags and mentions: Hashtags are keywords that are used to tag tweets\n",
        "so they can be more easily categorised and found by users while mentions are used to tag\n",
        "and address Twitter users whose names occur in a tweet. These hashtags and mentions\n",
        "will enable users to find and talk about the topic.\n",
        "- Emotional divergence and Individual Sentiment: Positive, negative or neutral sentiment\n",
        "valence can possibly influence the number of retweets.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Regarding data analysis and mining, many methods are still at an early stage of\n",
        "development. Existing computational methods exhibit weaknesses when dealing with large\n",

However, there are challenges in studying large data in social media platform such as Twitter. For the consistent prediction of viral tweets, it is not enough to consider the profile of influencer, structural, content-based, or sentimental aspects in isolation. It is recommended that a combination of these approaches be utilised for high prediction quality. There are still many areas to be studied further, such as community clusters and more algorithms to keep up with the complexity of analysing such a dynamic and a large amount of data. Moreover, there is an ongoing privacy issue with regards to studying online data.\n",
